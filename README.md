**Valorank** is a versatile Node.js backend application designed to track and serve real-time VALORANT statistics. It's perfect for streamers who want to display dynamic stats on their overlays, or for players who wish to track their progress with a custom solution.

The application provides flexible API endpoints and generates static HTML pages for advanced data visualization.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Flexible API**: Provides endpoints for tracking Win/Loss, rank information, RR, and session progress.
- **Customizable Outputs**: Most endpoints allow for personalization of the text response format.
- **Stats Page Generator**: Automatically creates a detailed, static HTML page (`/statystyki`) with daily charts and statistics for a configured player.
- **Documentation Generator**: Automatically generates clean API documentation from a configuration file.
- **Discord Logging**: Sends notifications about server status, errors, and important events to a Discord webhook.
- **Cron Jobs**: Automatically refreshes statistics at scheduled times.
- **Local Leaderboard**: Utilizes a local `leaderboard.json` file for fast lookups of top-ranked players without constant API calls. (Has to be manually updated each act for now)
- **Clean Project Structure**: The application logic is neatly organized into services, routes, utilities, and scripts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Scheduled Tasks**: `node-cron`
- **Date Formatting**: `Day.js`, `date-fns-tz`
- **Console Logging**: `picocolors`
- **Environment Variables**: `dotenv`

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16.x or newer recommended)
- npm

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mkornela/valorank.git
    cd valorank
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. You can copy the contents from `.env.example` or create it from scratch.

    ```ini
    # Server Configuration
    PORT=7312

    # API Key (Required)
    HENRIKDEV_API_KEY="your_henrikdev_api_key_here"

    # Player for the /statystyki page
    STATS_PLAYER_NAME="YourPlayerName"
    STATS_PLAYER_TAG="1234"
    STATS_PLAYER_REGION="eu"

    # Discord Integration (Optional)
    DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=""
    DISCORD_USER_ID_ON_ERROR=""
    ```

4.  **Prepare the leaderboard file:**
    The application requires a local `leaderboard.json` file for the `/getrank` endpoint to work.
    - Place your `leaderboard.json` file inside the `src/data/` directory.
    - This file is **not** updated automatically. You must provide it yourself.

5.  **Generate static files:**
    Before starting the server for the first time, you need to generate the HTML files for the documentation and stats pages.
    ```bash
    # Generates docs.html (the root page)
    npm run docs

    # Generates valorant_stats.html (the /statystyki page)
    npm run stats
    ```

6.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The server will be available at `http://localhost:7312` (or the port defined in your `.env` file).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

All configuration variables are managed in the `.env` file:

- `PORT`: The port on which the server will run.
- `HENRIKDEV_API_KEY`: Your API key from the [HenrikDev API](https://docs.henrikdev.xyz/). **This is required.**
- `STATS_PLAYER_NAME`, `STATS_PLAYER_TAG`, `STATS_PLAYER_REGION`: The player data for whom the `/statystyki` page is generated.
- `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`: A Discord webhook URL for event logging.
- `DISCORD_USER_ID_ON_ERROR`: A Discord user ID to be pinged in case of a critical error.

## üîó API Endpoints

Below is a summary of the main API endpoints. Full documentation is available on the root page (`/`) after starting the server.

| Endpoint                                | Method | Description                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/wl/{name}/{tag}/{region}`             |  GET   | Returns the Win/Loss stats for the current session.                         |
| `/advanced_wl/{name}/{tag}/{region}`    |  GET   | Returns W/L along with details about the last match (result & RR change).   |
| `/rank/{name}/{tag}/{region}`           |  GET   | Returns information about rank, RR, and progress to the next rank.          |
| `/getrank/{position}`                   |  GET   | Returns information about a player at a specific leaderboard position (EU). |
| `/statystyki`                           |  GET   | Serves a full HTML page with advancedplayer statistics. Made for @Szzalony  |
